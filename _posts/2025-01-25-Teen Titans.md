## Christmas with the Bat

Perhaps late to the party, a month too late to be exact, I always did have a particular fondness for holiday inspired Batman episodes. Something about how even the caped crusader has crisis to resolve during the holiday season brings much Joy to me.

## Christmas with the Joker

The second produced episode of the beloved Batman The Animated Series (1992) was Christmas with the Joker. Although I found it interesting that the airdate order is actually #38 on November 13, 1992. A little disappointing as I would hope the episode would air a little closer to Christmas. 

In the beginning of the episode, Robin pushes Batman to watch It's a Wonderful Life with him if there is no crime to fight on Christmas Eve. [It's a Wonderful life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life) is actually a very popular Christmas movie by the way released in 1946.
