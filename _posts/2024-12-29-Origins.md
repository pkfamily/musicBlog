Refer to the embedded video below. How can one not create this Batman blog upon seeing that line of dialogue. If not me, someone else surely would have taken up the task!

The lines from <r>Robin</r> that started it all.

## The Joining (Part 1)

For context, the lines comes after Robin questions Bruce Wayne after he finds out Lucious Fox knows Batman's secret identity in The Batman (2007) episode, S04.E12. [The Joining (Part 1)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0856357/). 

In this episode, mysterious events are underfoot where unbeknownst to Batman, Wayne industries is building something seemingly devious. It is up to the world's greatest detective and his two sidekicks, Batgirl and Robin, to uncover this mystery. As the mystery unfolds, Batman gets help from a stranger, John Jones who is new to the Gotham PD. A stranger who seems to knows Batman is Bruce Wayne. Maybe it is on the internet haha. Towards the end of the episode, we find out who the true identity of John Jones is. It should be of no suprise to DC fans. 

## Martian Manhunter

It's Martian Manhunter of course. The shape-shifting, super-strength, cloaking, mind-reading, material-phaser and flying alien from Mars whose entire civilization was destroyed by the Joining. With powers that overpowered, I do wonder how his people got defeated. At any rate, he has come to Earth to prevent the same thing from happening to his home planet. The introduction to Martian Manhunter is very similar in premise to the first Justice League (2001) episode S01E01: [Secret Origins](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0618170/).

Very similar designs for Martian Manhunter between both TV series. Though I think the version from The Batman seems more serious and more sure of himself.

## The Creation of the Justice League

After Earth's first encounter with the Joining, the Justice League is formed at end in both The Batman (2007): The Joining Part 2 S04.E13 as well as in the Justice League (2001): Secret Origins Part 2 S01.E02. At the end of the Joining Part 2 episode, Batman is invited to a super hero group by Martian Manhunter. They were both then teleported to a space station where Green Latern, Hawkman, Green Arrow, and Flash were there to greet them.

Batman agrees to join the group and the Justice League is formed! I do wonder how the space station was funded given Batman didn't pay for it. Maybe Green Arrow did but I didn't know he had that much green. This current version of the Justice League also has bit too much green to be honest. Like Green Latern, Green Arrow, and Martian Manhunter! 3/6 of the League are basically entirely green. Need Superman and Wonder Woman to balance it out.
